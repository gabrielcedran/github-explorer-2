## Creating a new React project from scratch (not using create-react-app)

1. Initialize the repository with the command `yarn init -y` (if yarn is not available or won't be used `npm init -y`). This step will create a package.json in the folder where the command was executed.
2. Add react's dependency - `yarn add react`
3. Add react-dom's dependency - `yarn add react-dom` (react's component for web development. Allows react to manipulation the dom)
4. Create the project's structure (public and src)
